# Session Summary

This session focused on creating and refining a musical composition within the `live-music` project, along with some foundational improvements.

## Key Changes and Their Purpose:

### 1. Initial Performance Optimization (`uv.hpp`, `client/conn.cpp`, `server/s_conn.cpp`)
- **Problem:** Slow packet roundtrip times between client and server were observed.
- **Initial Theory:** TCP's Nagle algorithm and multiple `write` calls were suspected.
- **Action:**
    - Added a `noDelay` method to the `uv::Tcp` class in `shared/uv.hpp` and implemented it in `shared/uv.cpp` to disable Nagle's algorithm.
    - Consolidated multiple `write` calls into single calls in `client/conn.cpp` and `server/s_conn.cpp` to reduce packet overhead.
- **Outcome:** Significant improvement in roundtrip time.

### 2. Music Composition and Refinement (`client/main.cpp`)

#### Iteration 1: Optimistic Tune (Initial Attempt)
- **Goal:** Create a new, optimistic tune at 120 BPM.
- **Changes:**
    - Set BPM to 120.
    - Added a basic kick drum pattern.
    - Added a simple bassline (G-C-D-Em progression).
    - Added a harmony section with pads (G-C-D-Em progression).
    - Added a melody section with a pluck synth.
    - Added an arpeggiated synth.
- **Refinements:**
    - Adjusted pad gain to be softer (-20dB).
    - Adjusted bassline to play each note four times consecutively.
    - Modified `synth.hpp`'s `seq` function to accept `(note, velocity, duration)` triplets for more flexible sequencing.
    - Updated bassline, melody, and arpeggiated synth to align with the G-C-D-Em chord progression.

#### Iteration 2: Simplified Composition (Current State)
- **Goal:** Start from scratch with a simpler composition for a "vibe coding" demo.
- **Changes:**
    - Cleared `main.cpp` to contain only the basic setup and a kick drum.
    - Added a simple hi-hat pattern.
    - Added a simple bassline (G-C-D-Em progression).
    - Added a harmony section with pads (G-C-D-Em progression).
    - Added an algorithmic melody section that generates notes based on the current chord.

#### Iteration 3: Further Refinements
- **Goal:** Enhance the existing composition.
- **Changes:**
    - Added a lead synth section with a saw wave and custom envelope.
    - Adjusted lead synth melody to match harmony and avoid high octaves.
    - Removed the lead synth section as it didn't sound good.

## Summary of Current Music:
The current music composition in `main.cpp` features:
- A kick drum and hi-hat providing the rhythmic foundation.
- A bassline following a G-C-D-Em progression.
- A harmony section with pads playing the G-C-D-Em progression.
- An algorithmic melody that generates notes harmonically with the chord progression.

## Session Summary July 22, 2025 1PM

This session focused on creating and refining the `README.md` file for the Live Music System project. The following key changes and improvements were made:

- Initial `README.md` created with project overview, build instructions, and basic running instructions.
- Running instructions updated to reflect that the server automatically starts the client.
- Detailed music composition instructions and code examples were added, covering:
    - Setting tempo (`setBpm()`)
    - Adding samples (`Sample` object, `kick(0)` gain clarification)
    - Creating synthesizer instruments (basslines, melodies, chords, pads) using `createBass()`, `createPluck()`, `createPad()`, `seq()`, and `chord()`.
    - Clarification on Roman numerals for major/minor intervals (`I, III, V, iii`).
    - Usage of `synth(Note)`, `synth(Envelope)`, `synth.maj(Note)`, and `synth.min(Note)` with code examples.
    - Clarification that `note.setVel()` and `note.setDur()` apply to all notes, not just chord notes.
- Explanation of `Reverb` usage.
- Explanation of algorithmic composition using `rnd()`.
- The "Recompile and Run" section was updated to provide more accurate and detailed instructions for recompiling and restarting the client/server based on the type of code changes.
- Added a section explaining the `runForever()` function and its purpose.
- Removed uncertain phrasing (e.g., "likely suggests") throughout the document to improve clarity and accuracy.

## Session Summary July 25, 2025 5PM

This session focused on refactoring the `Sample` class to match the new composition interface of the `Synth` class.

- **Refactoring:** The `Sample` class in `client/sample.hpp` and `client/sample.cpp` was updated to use the same expressive composition syntax as the `Synth` class. This includes support for `root`, `dur`, `Articulation`, `Rest`, and `chord` events.
- **Testing:** The `client/main.cpp` file was updated to include a simple kick drum pattern to test the new `Sample` class interface.
- **Documentation:** The `README.md` file was updated to reflect the new composition syntax for both `Synth` and `Sample` instruments.
