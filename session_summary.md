# Session Summary

This session focused on creating and refining a musical composition within the `live-music` project, along with some foundational improvements.

## Key Changes and Their Purpose:

### 1. Initial Performance Optimization (`uv.hpp`, `client/conn.cpp`, `server/s_conn.cpp`)
- **Problem:** Slow packet roundtrip times between client and server were observed.
- **Initial Theory:** TCP's Nagle algorithm and multiple `write` calls were suspected.
- **Action:**
    - Added a `noDelay` method to the `uv::Tcp` class in `shared/uv.hpp` and implemented it in `shared/uv.cpp` to disable Nagle's algorithm.
    - Consolidated multiple `write` calls into single calls in `client/conn.cpp` and `server/s_conn.cpp` to reduce packet overhead.
- **Outcome:** Significant improvement in roundtrip time.

### 2. Music Composition and Refinement (`client/main.cpp`)

#### Iteration 1: Optimistic Tune (Initial Attempt)
- **Goal:** Create a new, optimistic tune at 120 BPM.
- **Changes:**
    - Set BPM to 120.
    - Added a basic kick drum pattern.
    - Added a simple bassline (G-C-D-Em progression).
    - Added a harmony section with pads (G-C-D-Em progression).
    - Added a melody section with a pluck synth.
    - Added an arpeggiated synth.
- **Refinements:**
    - Adjusted pad gain to be softer (-20dB).
    - Adjusted bassline to play each note four times consecutively.
    - Modified `synth.hpp`'s `seq` function to accept `(note, velocity, duration)` triplets for more flexible sequencing.
    - Updated bassline, melody, and arpeggiated synth to align with the G-C-D-Em chord progression.

#### Iteration 2: Simplified Composition (Current State)
- **Goal:** Start from scratch with a simpler composition for a "vibe coding" demo.
- **Changes:**
    - Cleared `main.cpp` to contain only the basic setup and a kick drum.
    - Added a simple hi-hat pattern.
    - Added a simple bassline (G-C-D-Em progression).
    - Added a harmony section with pads (G-C-D-Em progression).
    - Added an algorithmic melody section that generates notes based on the current chord.

#### Iteration 3: Further Refinements
- **Goal:** Enhance the existing composition.
- **Changes:**
    - Added a lead synth section with a saw wave and custom envelope.
    - Adjusted lead synth melody to match harmony and avoid high octaves.
    - Removed the lead synth section as it didn't sound good.

## Summary of Current Music:
The current music composition in `main.cpp` features:
- A kick drum and hi-hat providing the rhythmic foundation.
- A bassline following a G-C-D-Em progression.
- A harmony section with pads playing the G-C-D-Em progression.
- An algorithmic melody that generates notes harmonically with the chord progression.
